<!-- Instructions:

    In groups of 4, begin the process of coding out the rock-paper-scissors game.

    Do as much as you can on your own, but don't be afraid to ask for help if you feel your team is struggling.

    Note: Don't use document.write as it will delete the contents of the body, including your javascript. Instead, use document.getElementById in conjunction with the textContent property, as you were shown earlier.

    Note: Don’t worry. We know this is a very challenging assignment. We also know that you won’t know where to start. In fact, we haven’t shown you EVERYTHING you need yet, but that’s okay. Part of being a developer is figuring things out on your own through trial and error. -->
